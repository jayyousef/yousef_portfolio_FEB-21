# yousef_portfolio_FEB-21

## Description

This is a one-page portfolio built with html+CSS, formatted primarily with flexbox.


## Status

The project is still in development, but what currently exists in this repository is a close to final form that can be updated and built upon later. It also contains several placeholders of projects that will be completed and updated to the site in the next few months.

## Installation and Use

In order to use this or work on this project on your own, fork the project to your own github account and use the Git Clone function to bring the repository to your own machine and edit away! It doesn't contain any Javascript or Python, so it will be easy for anyone to use who is familiar with HTML+CSS!

## Bugs

###### Known Bugs

The form doesn't actually submit anything because the functionality is not currently built into the page, but that will be udpated soon so that it can be used buy companies to send requests to the page owner.
